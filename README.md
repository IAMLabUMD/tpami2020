# Leveraging Hand-Object Interactions in Assistive Egocentric Vision
Sharing the codes and datasets used in the evaluation for our TPAMI paper with the title, _Leveraging Hand-Object Interactions in Assistive Egocentric Vision_.

Following are our TODOs to make our codes and datasets available in the public:
* Provide a link or a script to download datasets used in the evaluation.
* Share the codes for the hand segmentation model.
* Share the codes for the hand-object models.
* Share the codes for the variants of Faster R-CNN.
* Provide step-by-step instructions to train and evaluate all these models.
